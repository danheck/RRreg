\title{Univariate analysis of randomized response data}
\usage{
RRuni(response, data, model, p, group = NULL, MLest = TRUE, Kukrep = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{response}{either vector of responses containing 0='no' and 1='yes' or name of response variable in \code{data}.For the Forced Response (\code{FR}) model, response values are integers from 0 to (m-1), where 'm' is the number of response categories.  In Kuk's card playing method (\code{Kuk}), the observed response variable gives the number of red cards.}

\item{data}{optional \code{data.frame} containing the response variable}

\item{model}{defines RR model. Available models: \code{"Warner"}, \code{"UQTknown"}, \code{"UQTunknown"}, \code{"Mangat"}, \code{"FR"}, \code{"Kuk"},\code{"Crosswise"}, \code{"Triangular"}, \code{"CDM"}, \code{"CDMsym"}, \code{"SLD"}, \code{"mix.norm"}, \code{"mix.exp"},\code{"mix.unknown"}, or \code{"custom"}. See argument \code{p} or type \code{vignette('RRreg')} for detailed specifications.}

\item{p}{randomization probability (see details or \code{vignette("RRreg")})}

\item{group}{a group vector of the same length as \code{response} containing values 1 or 2, only required for two-group models, which specify different randomization probabilities for two groups, e.g., \code{CDM} or \code{SLD}. If a data.frame \code{data} is provided, the variable \code{group} is searched within it.}

\item{MLest}{whether to use \code{optim} to get ML instead of moment estimates (only relevant if pi is outside of [0,1])}

\item{Kukrep}{number of repetitions of Kuk's card-drawing method}
}
\value{

\description{
Analyse a data vector \code{response} with a specified RR model (e.g., \code{Warner}) with known randomization probability \code{p}
}
\details{
Each RR design \code{model} differs in the definition of the randomization probability \code{p}, which is defined as a single probability for
 \itemize{
 \item \code{"Warner"}: Probabiltiy to get sensitive Question 
 \item \code{"Mangat"}: Prob. for noncarriers to respond truthfully (i.e., with No=0)
 \item \code{"Crosswise"}: Probability to respond 'yes' to irrelevant second question (coding of responses: 1=['no-no' or 'yes-yes']; 0=['yes-no' or 'no-yes'])
 \item \code{"Triangular"}: Probability to respond 'yes' to irrelevant second question (coding of responses: 0='no' to both questions (='circle'); 1='yes' to at least one question ('triangle'))
 } 
 and as a two-valued vector of probabilities for 
 \itemize{
 \item \code{"Kuk"}: Probability of red cards in first and second set, respectively (red=1, black=0); 
 \item Unrelated Question (\code{"UQTknown"}): Prob. to respond to sensitive question and known prevalence of 'yes' responses to unrelated question 
 \item Unrelated Question (\code{"UQTunknown"}): Prob. to respond to sensitive question in group 1 and 2, respectively
 \item Cheating Detection (\code{"CDM"}): Prob. to be prompted to say yes in group 1 and 2, respectively
 \item Symmetric CDM (\code{"CDMsym"}): 4-valued vector: Prob. to be prompted to say 'yes'/'no' in group 1 and 'yes'/'no' in group 2
 \item Stochastic Lie Detector (\code{"SLD"}): Prob. for noncarriers to reply with 0='no' in group 1 and 2, respectively
 \item Forced Response model (\code{"FR"}): m-valued vector (m=number of response categories) with the probabilities of being prompted to select response categories 0,1,..,m-1, respectively (requires \code{sum(p)<1})
\item RR as misclassification (\code{"custom"}): a quadratic misclassification matrix is specified, where the entry \code{p[i,j]} defines the probability of responding i (i-th row) given a true state of j (j-th column)) (see \code{\link{getPW}})
 }
 For the continuous RR models:
 \itemize{
 \item \code{"mix.norm"}: 3-valued vector - Prob. to respond to sensitive question and mean and SD of the masking normal distribution of the unrelated question
 \item \code{"mix.exp"}: 2-valued vector - Prob. to respond to sensitive question and mean of the masking exponential distribution of the unrelated question
 \item \code{"mix.unknown"}: 2-valued vector - Prob. of responding to sensitive question in group 1 and 2, respectively
 }

\examples{
# Generate responses of 1000 people according to Warner's model
# with an underlying true proportion of .3
genData <- RRgen(n=1000, pi=.3, model="Warner", p=.7)
# Analyse univariate data to estimate 'pi'
analyse <- RRuni(response=genData$response, model="Warner", p=.7)
summary(analyse)

# Generate data in line with the Stochastic Lie Detector 
# assuming that 90\% of the respondents answer truthfully
genData2 <- RRgen(n=1000, pi=.3, model="SLD", p=c(.2,.8), 
                  complyRates=c(.8,1),groupRatio=0.4)
analyse2 <- RRuni(response=genData2$response, model="SLD", 
                  p=c(.2,.8), group=genData2$group)
summary(analyse2)
