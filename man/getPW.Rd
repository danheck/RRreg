\title{Get Misclassification Matrices for RR Models}
\usage{
getPW(model, p, group = 1, par2 = NULL, Kukrep = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{one of the available models in the package \code{RRreg}:}

\item{p}{randomization probability}

\item{group}{group index (1 or 2) for two-group designs such as
\code{"UQTunknown"} or \code{"SLD"}}

\item{par2}{the second, estimated parameter in two-group designs (e.g., the
unknown prevalence of the irrelevant question in \code{"UQTunknown"}, the
t-parameter for truth in the \code{"SLD"})}

\item{Kukrep}{number of replications in Kuk's RR design (how many cards are
drawn)}
}
\description{
Given some randomization probabilities \code{p}, each RR design corresponds
to a misclassification matrix PW.  This square matrix has entries defined as:
\code{PW[i,j] = P(respond i | true state j)}.
}
\details{
The method is used internally for estimation. Moreover, the method
  might be useful to check the exact definition of the RR designs.

  Note that for two-group designs, the matrix depends on a second parameter
  that is estimated from the data (e.g., the unknown prevalence of the
  unknown question in the unrelated question technique). Hence, the matrix
  itself is not constant, but an estimate of a random variable itself.

\examples{
getPW(model = "Warner", p = 2 / 12)
getPW(model = "UQTknown", p = c(2 / 12, .3))
getPW(model = "UQTunknown", p = c(2 / 12, .10 / 12), group = 2, par2 = .4)
