\title{Generate randomized response data}
\usage{
RRgen(
  n,
  pi.true,
  model,
  p,
  complyRates = c(1, 1),
  sysBias = c(0, 0),
  groupRatio = 0.5,
  Kukrep = 1,
  trueState = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{sample size of generated data}

\item{pi.true}{true proportion in population (a vector for m-categorical \code{"FR"} or \code{"custom"} model)}

\item{model}{specifes the RR model, one of: \code{"Warner"}, \code{"UQTknown"}, \code{"UQTunknown"}, \code{"Mangat"}, \code{"Kuk"}, \code{"FR"}, \code{"Crosswise"}, \code{"Triangular"}, \code{"CDM"}, \code{"CDMsym"}, \code{"SLD"},  \code{"mix.norm"},  \code{"mix.exp"}, \code{"custom"}. See \code{vignette("RRreg")} for details.}

\item{p}{randomization probability (depending on model, see \code{\link{RRuni}} for details)}

\item{complyRates}{vector with two values giving the proportions of carriers and non-carriers who adhere to the instructions, respectively}

\item{sysBias}{probability of responding 'yes' (coded as 1) in case of non-compliance for carriers and non-carriers of the sensitive attribute, respectively. If \code{sysBias=c(0,0)}, carriers and non-carriers systematically give the nonsensitive response 'no' (also known as self-protective(SP)-'no' responses). If \code{sysBias=c(0,0.5)}, carriers always respond 'no' whereas non-carriers randomly select a response category. Note that \code{sysBias = c(0.5,0.5)} might be the best choice for \code{Kuk} and \code{Crosswise}. For the m-categorical \code{"FR"} or \code{"custom"} model, \code{sysBias} can be given as a probability vector for categories 0 to (m-1).}

\item{groupRatio}{proportion of participants in group 1. Only required for two-group models, e.g., \code{SLD} and \code{CDM}}

\item{Kukrep}{Number of repetitions of Kuk's procedure (how often red and black cards are drawn)}

\item{trueState}{optional vector containing true states of participants (i.e., 1 for carriers and 0 for noncarriers of sensitive attribute; for \code{FR}: values from 0,1,...,M-1 (M = number of response categories) which will be randomized according to the defined procedure (if specified, \code{n} and \code{pi.true} are ignored)}
}
\value{
\code{data.frame} including the variables \code{true} and \code{response} (and for \code{SLD} and \code{CDM} a third variable \code{group})
}
\description{
The method \code{RRgen} generates data according to a specified RR model, 
e.g., \code{"Warner"}. True states are either provided by a vector \code{trueState} or drawn randomly from a Bernoulli distribution. Useful for simulation and testing purposes, e.g., power analysis.
}
\details{
If \code{trueState} is specified, the randomized response procedure will be simulated for this vector, otherwise a random vector of length \code{n} with true proportion \code{pi.true} is drawn. Respondents answer biases can be simulated by adjusting the compliance rates: if \code{complyRates} is set to \code{c(1,1)}, all respondents adhere to the randomization procedure. If one or both rates are smaller than 1, \code{sysBias} determines whether noncompliant respondents systematically choose the nonsensitive category or whether they answer randomly. 

\code{SLD} - to generate data according to the stochastic lie detector with the proportion \code{t} of honest carriers, parameters are set to \code{complyRates=c(t,1)} and \code{sysBias=c(0,0)}

\code{CDM} - to generate data according to the cheating detection model with the proportion \code{gamma} of cheaters, parameters are set to \code{complyRates=c(1-gamma,1-gamma)} and \code{sysBias=c(0,0)}

\examples{
# Generate responses of 1000 people according to Warner's model,
# every participant complies to the RR procedure
genData <- RRgen(n=1000, pi.true=.3, model="Warner", p=.7)
colMeans(genData)

# use Kuk's model with two decks of cards, 
# p gives the proportions of red cards for carriers/noncarriers
genData <- RRgen(n=1000, pi.true=.4, model="Kuk", p=c(.4,.7))
colMeans(genData)

# Stochastic Lie Detector (SLD):
# Only 80\% of carriers answer according to the RR procedure
genData <- RRgen(n=1000, pi.true=.2, model="SLD", p=c(.2,.8),
                 complyRates=c(.8,1),sysBias=c(0,0))
colMeans(genData)
