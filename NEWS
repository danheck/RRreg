RRreg 0.3.0 (February 2015)
===========

* Logistic regression in RRlog now uses a combination of EM algorithm and gradient-based optimization (previously, only optim was used)
* Compute predicted values (incl. SE and CI) for logistic RR regression by predict.RRlog
* Bugfixes in RRlin for multiple nonRR predictors and infinite log-likelihood
* More detailed documentation (specification of p in RRuni, available models for RRlin)


RRreg 0.2.0 (November 2014)
===========

* new function powerplot() to plot power of the three implemented multivariate RR methods
* bootstrapped p-values in RRcor and correlations bound to [-1,1]
* random starting values and repeated optimization in RRlin
* RRsimu: increased stability; RRlin included; generating data for RRcor and RRlog separately; estimation of power
* continuous mixture RR models: "mix.norm" and "mix.exp" added to RRgen, RRuni, and RRcor, "mix.unknown" added to RRuni and RRcor


RRreg 0.1.3 (September 2014)
