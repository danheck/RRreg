RRreg 0.6.2 (March 2017)
===========

* New RR Model: Triangular Model
* Fixed image links in vignette
* Selective import of package functions
* Updated email address


RRreg 0.6.0 (December 2015)
===========

* Bug fixes for RRsimu and RRuni


RRreg 0.5.0 (November 2015)
===========

* New function RRmixed() to fit logistic RR regressions with mixed effects (random slope/intercept in hierarchical models) using RR data based on lme4
* New function getPW() to get misclassification matrices for the implemented RR designs
* New data set 'minarets' for demonstration (type: data(minarets) )
* Proper maximization in RRuni() to get ML estimates (instead of moment estimates)
* Possibility to use a "custom"" RR misclassification matrix in RRuni, RRgen, and RRlog


RRreg 0.4.1 (July 2015)
===========

* New function plot.RRlog to plot predictions and confidence interval for a logistic RR regression
* Bugfix in predict.RRlog
* Random starting values in RRlog for fit.n=1
* Updated dependencies

RRreg 0.3.0 (February 2015)
===========

* Logistic regression in RRlog now uses a combination of EM algorithm and gradient-based optimization (previously, only optim was used)
* Compute predicted values (incl. SE and CI) for logistic RR regression by predict.RRlog
* Bugfixes in RRlin for multiple nonRR predictors and infinite log-likelihood
* More detailed documentation (specification of p in RRuni, available models for RRlin)


RRreg 0.2.0 (November 2014)
===========

* new function powerplot() to plot power of the three implemented multivariate RR methods
* bootstrapped p-values in RRcor and correlations bound to [-1,1]
* random starting values and repeated optimization in RRlin
* RRsimu: increased stability; RRlin included; generating data for RRcor and RRlog separately; estimation of power
* continuous mixture RR models: "mix.norm" and "mix.exp" added to RRgen, RRuni, and RRcor, "mix.unknown" added to RRuni and RRcor


RRreg 0.1.3 (September 2014)
===========

* first stable release of RRreg
* data generation: RRgen, RRsimu
* statistical analysis: RRuni, RRlog, RRcor, RRlin
* one-group RR designs: Warner, Kuk, Mangat, FR, Crosswise UQTknown
* two-group RR designs: UQTunknown, CDM, CDMsym, SLD
