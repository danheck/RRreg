RRreg
=====

The package RRreg provides univariate and multivariate methods for randomized response (RR) survey designs (e.g., Warner, 1965). Univariate estimates of true proportions can be obtained using RRuni. RR variables can be used in multivariate analyses for correlations (RRcor), as dependent variable in a logistic regression (RRlog) and as predictors in a linear regression (RRlin). The function RRgen generates single RR data sets, whereas RRsimu generates and analyzes RR data repeatedly for simulation and bootstrap purposes.
