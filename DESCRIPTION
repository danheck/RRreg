Description: Univariate and multivariate methods to analyze randomized response 
    (RR) survey designs (e.g., Warner, S. L. (1965). Randomized response: A 
    survey technique for eliminating evasive answer bias. Journal of the 
    American Statistical Association, 60, 63â€“69). <doi:10.2307/2283137> 
    Besides univariate estimates of true proportions, RR variables can be used 
    for correlations, as dependent variable in a logistic regression (with or 
    without random effects), as predictors in a linear regression, or as 
    dependent variable in a beta-binomial ANOVA. For simulation and bootstrap 
    purposes, RR data can be generated according to several models.
