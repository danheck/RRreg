Description: Univariate and multivariate methods to analyze randomized response (RR) survey designs (e.g., Warner, S. L. (1965). Randomized response: A survey technique for eliminating evasive answer bias. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 60, 63–69). <doi:10.2307/2283137> Besides univariate estimates of true proportions, RR variables can be used for correlations, as dependent variable in a logistic regression (with or without random effects), as predictors in a linear regression, or as dependent variable in a beta-binomial ANOVA. For simulation and bootstrap purposes, RR data can be generated according to several models.
